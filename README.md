# 🌱 Farmvest — Invest in Agriculture with Confidence

[🌐 Live Demo](https://yuriidano.github.io/farmvest/)

**Farmvest** is a modern, responsive landing page designed to showcase agriculture investment opportunities with an engaging and user-friendly interface.

## 👨‍💻 About This Project
This project was fully implemented by me as a responsive landing page for an agricultural investment platform.

The design was based on an existing layout, but I implemented the layout from scratch, including responsive behavior, animations, and section structuring.

The focus was on flawless implementation, clean and semantic HTML markup, BEM-based CSS, and a user-friendly interface on all screen sizes.

This project demonstrates my ability to translate user interface design into responsive web pages.
